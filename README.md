Scripts for getting MSA for phylogenetics

## First steps
1. Get ouputs from a set of directories / files and rename sequences appropriately
2. Make a multiple alignment ORF by ORF (do I need a master list?) and then return MSA in multi-fasta 
3. Translate this into the correct format for BEAST analysis- note http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/tutorial-8
4. Draw some trees!
